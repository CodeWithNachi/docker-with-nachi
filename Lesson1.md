# Lesson 1

## Intention
 * Understand what is a image
 * Understand what is a container
 * Run a container
 * Stop a container

## Experiment 1
 1. Run the command `docker run --name mynginx -p 8090:80 -d nginx`
 1. InPrivate browsing or Incognito mode, go to the url localhost:8090
 1. We should see a "Welcome to nginx!" page
 1. We have run an nginx docker by the above command

## Experiment 2
 1. Run the command `docker ps`
 1. We should be seeing an output similar to the image below
 1. This command lists all the running container
 1. From the image we can observe the following
   1. The container ID of the container can be seen. The ID is generated by docker when a container is created.
   1. The name of the image that was used to create the container is 'nginx'. This is the last parameter of the Experiment 1 command
   1. The name of container is 'mynginx'. This is parameter passed as --name in the Experiment 1 command
   1. The status is indicating that it's up

## Experiment 3
 1. Run the command `docker stop mynginx`
 1. Run the command `docker ps`
 1. We can see that there are no running containers. `docker stop mynginx` command will stop the container named 'mynginx'
 1. InPrivate browsing or Incognito mode, when we go to the url localhost:8090, we will find that 'site can't be reached'. This is expected as we have stopped the container
 
## Experiment 4
 1. Run the command `docker ps -a`. This command shows all the containers (Including the ones that are stopped)
 1. We should be seeing an output similar to the below image
 1. From the image we can observe the following
   1. Most of the things are similare to Experiment 2
   1. The status of the container indicates that container has exited

## Experiment 5
 1. Run the command `docker start mynginx`. This command will start the exited container.
 1. Run the `docker ps -a` command. we can see that container is up
 1. Also we should be able to verify that the site is up in localhost:8090
 
## Experiment 6
 1. Run the command `docker stop mynginx`.
 1. Now then run the command `docker rm mynginx`. This command will remove the container completely
 1. Verify if the container is removed by running `docker ps -a`. The output should indicate there is no container in running state or exited state
 
## Experiment 7
 1. Run the command `docker create --name mynginx -p 8090:90 nginx`. This command creates a docker container but doesn't run it.
 1. As the container is not running, on hitting localhost:8090, we will find that 'site can't be reached'.
 1. Run the command `docker ps -a`. The output will be as shown in the figure. It will indicate the container is created but not running
 
## Experiment 8
 1. Run the command `docker start mynginx`
 1. This command will start the created container.
 1. We are not specifying the image name like expriment 1 because we have already created the container in experiment 7
 1. We can verify the container is running by running command `docker ps -a`
 1. We can also verify it by browsing localhost:8090

## Experiment 9
 1. Run the command `docker restart mynginx`. This command restarts the docker container. This can be understood by running the `docker ps` command and observing the up time.
 
## Experiment 10
 1. Run the command `docker pause mynginx`. This command pauses the docker container. This can be checked by running `docker ps -a`.
 1. At this staget the docker stop and docker pause will look similar. It would be jumping to too far to understand the difference.
 
## Experiment 11
 1. Run the command `docker unpause mynginx`. This will unpause the container.
 
## Experiment 12
 1. Run the command `docker kill mynginx`. The will kill the container.
 1. This command is similar to docker stop. We will look at the difference between docker stop and kill at a later lesson

## Summary
From the expreriments conducted till now we can infer the following
 * Container is something like a running application. Image is something like a binary that was used to spin up the application. (We will refine this view in the next lesson)
 * Image is used to create a container
 * The container can be different states such as (defined in Engine api v1.24 https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.24/)
   * created
   * restarting
   * running
   * paused
   * exited
   * dead
 * We will look in to state transition in a latter lesson
 * docker run command to create a container and get it running
 * docker create command to create a container
 * docker start command to move a container to running state from created or exited state
 * docker pause command to pause a container
 * docker unpause command to move a container from paused state to running state
 * docker stop/kill command to move a container from running state to exited state
 * docker ps command to list all running containers and all containers

## Test your self
 * What is an image?
 * What is a container?
 * What is the difference between a image and container?
