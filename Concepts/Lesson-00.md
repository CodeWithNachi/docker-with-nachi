# What is Docker

 * Without answering the question 'What is docker?', lets see what does docker provide us.
 * Docker provides us with the ability to package applications.
 * The packaged application (binary) is called as a docker image.
 * When the packaged application is run, the running instance of the packaged applicaiton is called as docker container.
 * Docker provides us with a infrastructure called docker registry to share/distribute packaged applicaitons (images).
 * Docker registry could be considered something similar to Android Play store or iOS app Store.
 * Docker hosts a docker registry called as [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
 * Apart from docker, there are many other hostings of docker registry. Some private and some public.
 * Now comming back to Docker, Docker is this infrastructure that makes it possible to package applications, run the packaged application and then share/distribute it.
