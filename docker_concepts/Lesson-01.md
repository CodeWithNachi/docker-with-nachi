# Similarity With Application

## Intention
 * Run a nginx web server application
 * Understand what is an image
 * Understand what is a container
 * Basic operations on a container
 * States of the container

## Experiment 1
 1. We can run a nginx web server application by the below command
```bash
docker run --name mynginx -p 8090:80 -d nginx
```
 1. Verify the application working by visiting [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090)
 1. We should be seeing the nginx welcome page
 1. We have now run a docker container (also an nginx application) from the nginx image

## Experiment 2
 1. We can see all the containers running by the below command
```bash
docker ps
```
 1. We should be seeing an output similar to the image below
![docker ps output](/Lesson-01-Experiment-02-Picture-01.PNG)
 1. This command lists all the running container
 1. From the image we can observe the following
   1. The container ID: This is generated by docker when the container is created
   1. The image name: This is the name of the image that was used to spin up the container
   1. The container name: The name of the container. This is passes as --name argument. If not passed, docker generates a randome name
   1. The status: The status of the container

## Experiment 3
 1. Till now we have run a container, and seen info about it. Now lets stop the container by the below command
```bash
docker stop mynginx
```
 1. Now we can verify that the container is stopped by running the below command
```bash
docker ps
```
 1. The output should be similar to the image below indicating there are no containers running.
 1. We can verify that the application is not running by visiting the page [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090) in incognito mode
 
## Experiment 4
 1. We have stopped the container and as expected the command `docker ps` is not showing our container.
 1. Lets see the stopped containers with `docker ps` command with `-a` option
```bash
docker ps -a
```
 1. The command should produce an output as the below image indicating that the container is stopped
![docker ps -a output](/Lesson-01-Experiment-04-Picture-01.PNG)
 1. From the image we can observe the status of the container is exited
 
## Experiment 5
 1. We now have a stopped container. Lets start it with the below command
```bash
docker start mynginx
```
 1. As seen earlier, we can confirm the container is running by the below command
```bash
docker ps
```
 1. Verify the application working by visiting [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090) in incognito mode
 
## Experiment 6
 1. As seen earlier, lets not stop the container. And remove it in the next step
```bash
docker stop mynginx
```
```bash
docker rm mynginx
```
 1. As seen earlier, we can verify there is no containers in the running or stopped state by the below command
```bash
docker ps -a`
```
 
## Experiment 7
 1. Run the command `docker create --name mynginx -p 8090:90 nginx`. This command creates a docker container but doesn't run it.
 1. As the container is not running, on hitting localhost:8090, we will find that 'site can't be reached'.
 1. Run the command `docker ps -a`. The output will be as shown in the figure. It will indicate the container is created but not running
 
## Experiment 8
 1. Run the command `docker start mynginx`
 1. This command will start the created container.
 1. We are not specifying the image name like expriment 1 because we have already created the container in experiment 7
 1. We can verify the container is running by running command `docker ps -a`
 1. We can also verify it by browsing localhost:8090

## Experiment 9
 1. Run the command `docker restart mynginx`. This command restarts the docker container. This can be understood by running the `docker ps` command and observing the up time.
 
## Experiment 10
 1. Run the command `docker pause mynginx`. This command pauses the docker container. This can be checked by running `docker ps -a`.
 1. At this staget the docker stop and docker pause will look similar. It would be jumping to too far to understand the difference.
 
## Experiment 11
 1. Run the command `docker unpause mynginx`. This will unpause the container.
 
## Experiment 12
 1. Run the command `docker kill mynginx`. The will kill the container.
 1. This command is similar to docker stop. We will look at the difference between docker stop and kill at a later lesson
 1. Run the command `docker rm mynginx` for now to remove the container.

## Summary
From the expreriments conducted till now we can infer the following
 * Container is something like a running application. Image is something like a binary that was used to spin up the application. (We will refine this view in the next lesson)
 * Image is used to create a container
 * The container can be different states such as (defined in Engine api v1.24 https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.24/)
   * created
   * restarting
   * running
   * paused
   * exited
   * dead
 * We will look in to state transition in a latter lesson
 * docker run command to create a container and get it running
 * docker create command to create a container
 * docker start command to move a container to running state from created or exited state
 * docker pause command to pause a container
 * docker unpause command to move a container from paused state to running state
 * docker stop/kill command to move a container from running state to exited state
 * docker ps command to list all running containers and all containers

## Test your self
 * What is an image?
 * What is a container?
 * What is the difference between a image and container?
 * Run, Stop, Remove the Container
   * Run a container from nginx image
   * Verfiy access to default page
   * Stop the container
   * Remove the container
 * Create, Start, Pause, Unpause, Stop and Remove
   * Create a nginx container
   * Start the created container
   * Verfiy access to default page
   * Pause the container
   * Verify the default page is not accessible
   * Unpause the container
   * Verfiy access to default page
   * Stop the container
   * Verify the default page is not accessible
   * Remove the container
   * Verify the removal with `docker ps -a` command
