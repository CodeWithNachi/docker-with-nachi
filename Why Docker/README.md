# Why Docker

Before learning the concepts of docker. Let understand the advantages of docker.

 * Docker makes it easy for developers to experiment with different applications.
 Gives developers to experiment with products. As a developer you might be considering which database to use. Lets say if you want to choose between MongoDB and PostGreSQL. Without docker (or containers) you might need to install both of these databases. Play around with it a bit and then decide. Post the experiment, you might need to uninstall the software. When docker is installed, just by running one command we can install MongoDB or PostGreSQL. Similarly with one command we can unistall it. Not only MongoDB and PostGreSQL, docker images are available for 1000s of softwares.
 
 * Makes it easy for sharing of applications: When you build applications, there are dependencies that application will have. For instance it might run in a Windows environment or Linux environment, or it might expect a specfic distro of linux. So we might need to communicate this to the end user or the person who is going to install or deploy. With docker we can package all the dependencies of the software together as one docker image. This makes it much easier for someone use the application.
 * Docker simplifies the setup of development environment:
 * Docker reduces the communications and co-ordination needed between dev and ops team:
 * Docker provides a high degree of isolation between different applications:
 * Orchestration tools like kubernetes, docker swarm that are build around containers (docker) make it easy to manage huge number of applications.
